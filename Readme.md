# Birdy

That's an educational project helping me to learn something about Rust.

It is fully based by awesome series of blogposts [Learning to Fly: Let's simulate evolution in Rust (pt 1)](https://pwy.io/posts/learning-to-fly-pt1/) by [pwy.io](https://pwy.io/).

The idea of it is to create birds eating some food and learning with genetic algorithm. The whole thing is written in Rust and WASM is used to display it in browser
